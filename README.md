### User Stories

### Versioning

> As of **January 6, 2018** this app is in development whilst enrolled in General Assembly's WDI program and is initilized in this GitHub repo. NPM init files created, navbar partials created.

> As of **January 7, 2018** I made a big push with styling and got 70% of the design implemented using Materialize... lots of battling with class inheritance. Proud of my landing product page.

> As of **January 8, 2018** created views for viewing all journal entries, created partial for quote api, updated layouts of landing page for user experience.

> As of **January 9, 2018** added dynamic updating of user journal entries on the "view all" page updated views to reflect information from user. Created basic routes in my index.js and controllers. Created user and post model.

> As of **January 10, 2018** ran into a bug that required to add constraints on certain javascript functions to only run on particular URLs where it needs to be executed. Continuing work on update post, delete post functionality.

> As of **January 11, 2018** finished update functionality now working on user authentication, a big endeavor.

> As of **January 12, 2018** here lies the MVP. I finished random quote functionality, tidying up code/routes/added initial screenshot, finished auth functionality, styling touchups, finding and squashing bugs and... preparing for heroku launch!
 

## If I had more time I would...

> Add the ability to save a quote to a list of favorites to view later... maybe a share to social link.

> Convert wireframes to digital file.

> Post Trello flow.
